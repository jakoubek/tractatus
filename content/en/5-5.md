Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of the operation <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">(−−−−−<span class="mathrm">T</span>)</span> (<var>ξ</var>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.)</span> to elementary propositions.
This operation denies all the propositions in the right-hand bracket and I call it the negation of these propositions.
