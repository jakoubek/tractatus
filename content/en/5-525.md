It is not correct to render the proposition “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<span class="symbol">∃</span><var>x</var>).</span><var>fx</var></span>”—as Russell does—in the words “<span class="mathmode"><var>fx</var></span> is <em>possible</em>”.
Certainty, possibility or impossibility of a state of affairs are not expressed by a proposition but by the fact that an expression is a tautology, a significant proposition or a contradiction.
That precedent to which one would always appeal, must be present in the symbol itself.
