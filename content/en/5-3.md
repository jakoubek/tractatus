All propositions are results of truth-operations on the elementary propositions.
The truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function arises from elementary propositions.
According to the nature of truth-operations, in the same way as out of elementary propositions arise their truth-functions, from truth-functions arises a new one. Every truth-operation creates from truth-functions of elementary propositions, another truth-function of elementary propositions <em>i.e.</em> a proposition. The result of every truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions is also the result of <em>one</em> truth-operation on elementary propositions.
Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.
