“<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel">.</span><var>q</var></span>” is one of the propositions which assert “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” and at the same time one of the propositions which assert “<span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>”.
Two propositions are opposed to one another if there is no significant proposition which asserts them both.
Every proposition which contradicts another, denies it.
