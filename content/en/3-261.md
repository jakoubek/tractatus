Every defined sign signifies <em>via</em> those signs by which it is defined, and the definitions show the way.
Two signs, one a primitive sign, and one defined by primitive signs, cannot signify in the same way. Names <em>cannot</em> be taken to pieces by definition (nor any sign which alone and independently has a meaning).
