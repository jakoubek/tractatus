Can we not make ourselves understood by means of false propositions as hitherto with true ones, so long as we know that they are meant to be false? No! For a proposition is true, if what we assert by means of it is the case; and if by “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” we mean <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>, and what we mean is the case, then “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” in the new conception is true and not false.
