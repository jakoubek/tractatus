The expression of the agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions expresses the truth-conditions of the proposition.
The proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions.
(Frege has therefore quite rightly put them at the beginning, as explaining the signs of his logical symbolism. Only Frege’s explanation of the truth-concept is false: if “the true” and “the false” were real objects and the arguments in <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>, etc., then the sense of <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span> would by no means be determined by Frege’s determination.)
