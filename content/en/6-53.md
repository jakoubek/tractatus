The right method of philosophy would be this: To say nothing except what can be said, <em>i.e.</em> the propositions of natural science, <em>i.e.</em> something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other—he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy—but it would be the only strictly correct method.
