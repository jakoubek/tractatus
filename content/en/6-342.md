And now we see the relative position of logic and mechanics. (We could construct the network out of figures of different kinds, as out of triangles and hexagons together.) That a picture like that instanced above can be described by a network of a given form asserts <em>nothing</em> about the picture. (For this holds of every picture of this kind.) But <em>this</em> does characterize the picture, the fact, namely, that it can be <em>completely</em> described by a definite net of <em>definite</em> fineness.
So too the fact that it can be described by Newtonian mechanics asserts nothing about the world; but <em>this</em> asserts something, namely, that it can be described in that particular way in which as a matter of fact it is described. The fact, too, that it can be described more simply by one system of mechanics than by another says something about the world.
