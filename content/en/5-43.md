That from a fact <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> an infinite number of <em>others</em> should follow, namely, <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>, <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>, etc., is indeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less wonderful that the infinite number of propositions of logic (of mathematics) should follow from half a dozen “primitive propositions”.
But the propositions of logic say the same thing. That is, nothing.
