If a notation is fixed, there is in it a rule according to which all the propositions denying <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> or <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span> are constructed, and so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their sense is mirrored.
