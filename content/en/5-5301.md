That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious. This becomes very clear if, for example, one considers the proposition “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<var>x</var>):</span><var>fx</var><span class="mathrel">.<span class="symbol">⊃</span>.</span><var>x</var><span class="mathrel">=</span><var>a</var></span>”. What this proposition says is simply that <em>only</em> <span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span> satisfies the function <span class="mathmode"><var>f</var></span>, and not that only such things satisfy the function <span class="mathmode"><var>f</var></span> which have a certain relation to <span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>.
One could of course say that in fact <em>only</em> <span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span> has this relation to <span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>, but in order to express this we should need the sign of identity itself.
