The determination of the values of the propositional variable is done by <em>indicating the propositions</em> whose common mark the variable is.
The determination is a description of these propositions.
The determination will therefore deal only with symbols not with their meaning.
And <em>only</em> this is essential to the determination, <em>that it is only a description of symbols and asserts nothing about what is symbolized</em>.
The way in which we describe the propositions is not essential.
