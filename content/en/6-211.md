In life it is never a mathematical proposition which we need, but we use mathematical propositions <em>only</em> in order to infer from propositions which do not belong to mathematics to others which equally do not belong to mathematics.
(In philosophy the question “Why do we really use that word, that proposition?” constantly leads to valuable results.)
