Must the sign of the negative proposition be constructed by means of the sign of the positive? Why should one not be able to express the negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (Like: if “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>” does not stand in a certain relation to “<span class="mathmode"><var>b</var></span>”, it could express that <span class="mathmode"><var>aRb</var></span> is not the case.)
But here also the negative proposition is indirectly constructed with the positive.
The positive <em>proposition</em> must presuppose the existence of the negative <em>proposition</em> and conversely.
