Propositions cannot represent the logical form: this mirrors itself in the propositions.
That which mirrors itself in language, language cannot represent.
That which expresses <em>itself</em> in language, <em>we</em> cannot express by language.
The propositions <em>show</em> the logical form of reality.
They exhibit it.
