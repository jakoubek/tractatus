It must be recognized in our symbols that what is connected by “∨”, “.”, etc., must be propositions.
And this is the case, for the symbols “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” and “<span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>” presuppose “∨”, “~”, etc. If the sign “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” in “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>q</var></span>” does not stand for a complex sign, then by itself it cannot have sense; but then also the signs “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>p</var></span>”, “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel">.</span><var>p</var></span>”, etc. which have the same sense as “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” have no sense. If, however, “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>p</var></span>” has no sense, then also “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>q</var></span>” can have no sense.
