Now it appears to be possible to give the most general form of proposition; <em>i.e.</em> to give a description of the propositions of some one sign language, so that every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol, which falls under the description, and so that every symbol which falls under the description can express a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen accordingly.
It is clear that in the description of the most general form of proposition <em>only</em> what is essential to it may be describedâ€”otherwise it would not be the most general form.
That there is a general form is proved by the fact that there cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been foreseen (<em>i.e.</em> constructed). The general form of proposition is: Such and such is the case.
