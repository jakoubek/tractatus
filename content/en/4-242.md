Expressions of the form “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var><span class="mathrel">=</span><var>b</var></span>” are therefore only expedients in presentation: They assert nothing about the meaning of the signs “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>” and “<span class="mathmode"><var>b</var></span>”.
