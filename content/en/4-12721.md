The formal concept is already given with an object, which falls under it. One cannot, therefore, introduce both, the objects which fall under a formal concept <em>and</em> the formal concept itself, as primitive ideas. One cannot, therefore, <em>e.g.</em> introduce (as Russell does) the concept of function and also special functions as primitive ideas; or the concept of number and definite numbers.
