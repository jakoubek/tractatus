The general term of the formal series <span class="mathmode"><var>a</var>, <span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><var>a</var>, <span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><var>a</var>,<span class="mathrel">…</span></span>. I write thus: “<span class="mathmode">[<var>a</var>, <var>x</var>, <span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><var>x</var>]</span>”. This expression in brackets is a variable. The first term of the expression is the beginning of the formal series, the second the form of an arbitrary term <span class="mathmode"><var>x</var></span> of the series, and the third the form of that term of the series which immediately follows <span class="mathmode"><var>x</var></span>.
