A completely generalized proposition is like every other proposition composite. (This is shown by the fact that in “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<span class="symbol">∃</span><var>x</var>, <var>φ</var>).</span><var>φx</var></span>” we must mention “<span class="mathmode"><var>φ</var></span>” and “<span class="mathmode"><var>x</var></span>” separately. Both stand independently in signifying relations to the world as in the ungeneralized proposition.)
A characteristic of a composite symbol: it has something in common with <em>other</em> symbols.
