Thus a proposition “<span class="mathmode"><var>fa</var></span>” shows that in its sense the object <span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span> occurs, two propositions “<span class="mathmode"><var>fa</var></span>” and “<span class="mathmode"><var>ga</var></span>” that they are both about the same object.
If two propositions contradict one another, this is shown by their structure; similarly if one follows from another, etc.
