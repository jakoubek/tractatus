The repeated application of an operation to its own result I call its successive application (“<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><var>a</var></span>” is the result of the threefold successive application of “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">O</span>’</span><var>ξ</var></span>” to “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>”).
In a similar sense I speak of the successive application of <em>several</em> operations to a number of propositions.
