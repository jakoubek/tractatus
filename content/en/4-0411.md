If we tried, for example, to express what is expressed by “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<var>x</var>).</span><var>fx</var></span>” by putting an index before <span class="mathmode"><var>fx</var></span>, like: “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop"><span class="mathrm">Gen.</span></span> <var>fx</var></span>”, it would not do, we should not know what was generalized. If we tried to show it by an index <span class="mathmode"><var>g</var></span>, like: “<span class="mathmode"><var>f</var>(<var>x</var><sub><var>g</var></sub>)</span>” it would not do—we should not know the scope of the generalization.
If we were to try it by introducing a mark in the argument places, like “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">(<var>G</var>, <var>G</var>).</span> <var>F</var>(<var>G</var>, <var>G</var>)</span>”, it would not do—we could not determine the identity of the variables, etc.
All these ways of symbolizing are inadequate because they have not the necessary mathematical multiplicity.
