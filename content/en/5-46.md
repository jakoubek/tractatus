When we have rightly introduced the logical signs, the sense of all their combinations has been already introduced with them: therefore not only “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>q</var></span>” but also “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span>(<var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>q</var>)</span>”, etc. etc. We should then already have introduced the effect of all possible combinations of brackets; and it would then have become clear that the proper general primitive signs are not “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>q</var></span>”, “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<span class="symbol">∃</span><var>x</var>).</span><var>fx</var></span>”, etc., but the most general form of their combinations.
