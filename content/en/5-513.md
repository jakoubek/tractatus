We could say: What is common to all symbols, which assert both <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> and <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>, is the proposition “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel">.</span><var>q</var></span>”. What is common to all symbols, which asserts either <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> or <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>, is the proposition “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>q</var></span>”.
And similarly we can say: Two propositions are opposed to one another when they have nothing in common with one another; and every proposition has only one negative, because there is only one proposition which lies altogether outside it.
Thus in Russell’s notation also it appears evident that “<span class="mathmode"><var>q</var><span class="mathrel">:</span><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” says the same thing as “<span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>”; that “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” says nothing.
