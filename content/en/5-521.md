I separate the concept <em>all</em> from the truth-function.
Frege and Russell have introduced generality in connexion with the logical product or the logical sum. Then it would be difficult to understand the propositions “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<span class="symbol">∃</span><var>x</var>).</span><var>fx</var></span>” and “<span class="mathmode"><span class="quant">(<var>x</var>).</span><var>fx</var></span>” in which both ideas lie concealed.
