The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies <em>shows</em> the formal—logical—properties of language, of the world.
That its constituent parts connected together <em>in this way</em> give a tautology characterizes the logic of its constituent parts.
In order that propositions connected together in a definite way may give a tautology they must have definite properties of structure. That they give a tautology when <em>so</em> connected shows therefore that they possess these properties of structure.
