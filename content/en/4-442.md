Thus <em>e.g.</em>
<!-- noindent --><div class="centered"><table class="truthtable"><tr><th>“</th><th class="l"><span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span></th><th class="m"><span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span></th><th class="e"></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td class="l">T</td><td class="m">T</td><td class="e">T</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td class="l">F</td><td class="m">T</td><td class="e">T</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td class="l">T</td><td class="m">F</td><td class="e"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td class="l">F</td><td class="m">F</td><td class="e">T</td><td>”</td></tr></table></div>
<!-- flushright --> is a propositional sign.
(Frege’s assertion sign “<span class="mathmode">⊢</span>” is logically altogether meaningless; in Frege (and Russell) it only shows that these authors hold as true the propositions marked in this way. “<span class="mathmode">⊢</span>” belongs therefore to the propositions no more than does the number of the proposition. A proposition cannot possibly assert of itself that it is true.)
If the sequence of the truth-possibilities in the schema is once for all determined by a rule of combination, then the last column is by itself an expression of the truth-conditions. If we write this column as a row the propositional sign becomes:
<div class="centered"><span class="mathmode"> “<span class="mathop">(<span class="mathrm">TT–T</span>)</span>&nbsp; (<var>p</var>, <var>q</var>)”, </span></div><span class="mathmode"></span>
<!-- noindent --> or more plainly:
<div class="centered"><span class="mathmode">“<span class="mathop">(<span class="mathrm">TTFT</span>)</span>&nbsp; (<var>p</var>, <var>q</var>)”.</span></div><span class="mathmode"></span>
(The number of places in the left-hand bracket is determined by the number of terms in the right-hand bracket.)
