We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example, <em>can be replaced</em> by the notations of “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” (“not <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>”) and “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><var>q</var></span>” (“<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> or <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>”).
(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)
