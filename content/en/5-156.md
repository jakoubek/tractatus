Probability is a generalization.
It involves a general description of a propositional form.
Only in default of certainty do we need probability. If we are not completely acquainted with a fact, but know <em>something</em> about its form.
(A proposition can, indeed, be an incomplete picture of a certain state of affairs, but it is always <em>a</em> complete picture.)
The probability proposition is, as it were, an extract from other propositions.
