If <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> follows from <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>, I can conclude from <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span> to <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>; infer <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> from <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>.

Only they themselves can justify the inference.
Laws of inference, which—as in Frege and Russell—are to justify the conclusions, are senseless and would be superfluous.
