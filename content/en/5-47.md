It is clear that everything which can be said <em>beforehand</em> about the form of <em>all</em> propositions at all can be said <em>on one occasion</em>.
For all logical operations are already contained in the elementary proposition. For “<span class="mathmode"><var>fa</var></span>” says the same as
<div class="centered"><span class="mathmode">“<span class="quant">(<span class="symbol">∃</span><var>x</var>).</span><var>fx</var><span class="mathrel">.</span><var>x</var><span class="mathrel">=</span><var>a</var>”.</span></div><span class="mathmode"></span>
Where there is composition, there is argument and function, and where these are, all logical constants already are.
One could say: the one logical constant is that which <em>all</em> propositions, according to their nature, have in common with one another.
That however is the general form of proposition.
