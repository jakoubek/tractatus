This remark provides a key to the question, to what extent solipsism is a truth.
In fact what solipsism <em>means</em>, is quite correct, only it cannot be <em>said</em>, but it shows itself.
That the world is <em>my</em> world, shows itself in the fact that the limits of the language (<em>the</em> language which I understand) mean the limits of <em>my</em> world.
