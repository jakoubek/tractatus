Propositions which have no truth-arguments in common with one another we call independent.
Independent propositions (<em>e.g.</em> any two elementary propositions) give to one another the probability <span class="mathmode">Â½</span>.
If <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> follows from <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span>, the proposition <span class="mathmode"><var>q</var></span> gives to the proposition <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> the probability 1. The certainty of logical conclusion is a limiting case of probability.
(Application to tautology and contradiction.)
