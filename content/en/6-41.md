The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. <em>In</em> it there is no valueâ€”and if there were, it would be of no value.
If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.
What makes it non-accidental cannot lie <em>in</em> the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.
It must lie outside the world.
