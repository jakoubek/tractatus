Frege says: Every legitimately constructed proposition must have a sense; and I say: Every possible proposition is legitimately constructed, and if it has no sense this can only be because we have given no <em>meaning</em> to some of its constituent parts.
(Even if we believe that we have done so.)
Thus “Socrates is identical” says nothing, because we have given <em>no</em> meaning to the word “identical” as <em>adjective</em>. For when it occurs as the sign of equality it symbolizes in an entirely different way—the symbolizing relation is another—therefore the symbol is in the two cases entirely different; the two symbols have the sign in common with one another only by accident.
