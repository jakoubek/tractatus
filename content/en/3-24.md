A proposition about a complex stands in internal relation to the proposition about its constituent part.
A
complex can only be given by its description, and this will either be
right or wrong. The proposition in which there is mention of a complex,
if this does not exist, becomes not nonsense but simply false.
That a propositional element signifies a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs. We <em>know</em> that everything is not yet determined by this proposition. (The notation for generality <em>contains</em> a prototype.)
The combination of the symbols of a complex in a simple symbol can be expressed by a definition.
