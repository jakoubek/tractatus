Truth-functions are not material functions.
If <em>e.g.</em> an affirmation can be produced by repeated denial, is the denial—in any sense—contained in the affirmation? Does “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” deny <span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>, or does it affirm <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>; or both?
The proposition “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” does not treat of denial as an object, but the possibility of denial is already prejudged in affirmation.
And if there was an object called “~”, then “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” would have to say something other than “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>”. For the one proposition would then treat of ~, the other would not.
