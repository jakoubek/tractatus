If one does not observe that propositions have a sense independent of the facts, one can easily believe that true and false are two relations between signs and things signified with equal rights.
One could, then, for example, say that “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” signifies in the true way what “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” signifies in the false way, etc.
