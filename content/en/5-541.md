At first sight it appears as if there were also a different way in which one proposition could occur in another.
Especially in certain propositional forms of psychology, like “A thinks, that <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> is the case”, or “A thinks <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>”, etc.
Here it appears superficially as if the proposition <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span> stood to the object A in a kind of relation.
(And in modern epistemology (Russell, Moore, etc.) those propositions have been conceived in this way.)
