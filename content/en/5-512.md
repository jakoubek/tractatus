“<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” is true if “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” is false. Therefore in the true proposition “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” “<span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>” is a false proposition. How then can the stroke “~” bring it into agreement with reality?
That which denies in “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>” is however not “~”, but that which all signs of this notation, which deny <span class="mathmode"><var>p</var></span>, have in common.
Hence the common rule according to which “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>”, “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>”, “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var><span class="mathrel"><span class="symbol">∨</span></span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>”, “<span class="mathmode"><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var><span class="mathrel">.</span><span class="mathop">~</span><var>p</var></span>”, etc. etc. (to infinity) are constructed. And this which is common to them all mirrors denial.
