If I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by putting between them the sign “=”.
“<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var><span class="mathrel">=</span><var>b</var></span>” means then, that the sign “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>” is replaceable by the sign “<span class="mathmode"><var>b</var></span>”.
(If I introduce by an equation a new sign “<span class="mathmode"><var>b</var></span>”, by determining that it shall replace a previously known sign “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var></span>”, I write the equation—definition—(like Russell) in the form “<span class="mathmode"><var>a</var><span class="mathrel">=</span><var>b</var></span> Def.”. A definition is a symbolic rule.)
